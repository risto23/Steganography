# Steganography

An Android application which allows users to hide text or image within the image and be able to share it 
using external messaging applications. In addition to that, users are able to extract the embedded text or 
image from the stegoed image. This establishes a secure way to share a classified message. The 
steganography is performed by encrypting the message using random 24-bit key and the message is embedded 
using Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm. The high resolution of cover image enables to hide approximately 560 MB of message.

This application is a further development of https://github.com/alexparunov/steganographer by adding a password 
when embed and extract the message.The password must be 6 characters long.
